In the first four weeks under the guidance of my mentor Virendra Kabra, I have learnt and implemented some fascinating code and also have been exposed to the world of CP
The following topics have been covered :
1- Introduction to C++ and brief overview of CP
2- Sorting and Searching algorithms
3- Graph algorithms (dfs and bfs along with examples)
4- Greedy alg with examples and dsu
5- Range Queries
6- Flows and Tries
